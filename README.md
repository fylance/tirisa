tirisa
======

A Java Page Object Generator for Web-Application Test-Automation.

Right now Tirisa is an experimental tool to create automated web-application tests - easily, fast and reliable.

The page objects are created automatically from the target websites delivered source code.
Tirisa is build atop of Htmlunit, Selenium, TestNG and Apache Velocity.

This project is inspired by Marcus Merrell's brilliant talk [Self-Generating Test Artifacts for Selenium/WebDriver (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSCFsUOgPpw) on Youtube. However, in contrast to Marcus Merell's [tastymonster](https://github.com/mmerrell/tastymonster) project, it attempts to create the page objects directly from the target websites delivered source code rather than from the websites source code templates (please correct me, if I got this wrong :)).
